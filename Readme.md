# MicroFrontend Basic Demo

## Get started
This repo contains 2 projects: `Host` and `Remote`  
We need to use both simultaneously, open both projects in separate terminals and do the following in both

```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

The host project will run on [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001)  
The remote project will run on [http://localhost:3002](http://localhost:3002)
